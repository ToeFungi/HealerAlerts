# HealerAlerts

HealerAlerts is a lightweight, purpose-built addon for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King that provides clear, automatic status callouts for healers, ensuring groups are never caught off guard during combat.

## Key Features

#### Automatic announcements for:

- Low mana
- Out of mana
- Low health
- Healer death

#### Fully configurable:

- Adjustable mana and health thresholds
- Per-alert enable/disable toggles
- Global cooldown to prevent chat spam
- Zero micromanagement once configured

#### Smart Chat Channel Selection

- Raid Chat when in a raid group
- Party Chat when in a party or dungeons
- Yell when not grouped
- Optional setting to suppress announcements unless grouped

This ensures alerts are always delivered to the players who need them most, without manual switching or setup, making HealerAlerts ideal for both five-man content and raids.
